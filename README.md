                     |Determine the level of specificity the person asking the question will need - should I ask them to count steps, or will vague directions be enough? Tailor your output to the desired audience.	
                    | Determine the landmarks that should be used to identify if the user is on the right track, e.g. Customer Service, or the student lounge	
                    | Determine the landmarks that should be used to determine if the user has gone too far, e.g. Room 408 (the room with a full-length glass window to the side)
